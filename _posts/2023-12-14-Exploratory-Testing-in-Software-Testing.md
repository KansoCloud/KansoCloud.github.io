## **Introduction**

**Exploratory Testing** is an approach to software testing that is often described as simultaneous learning, test design, and execution. This blog attempts to discuss how Exploratory Testing can complement manual scripted and automated testing in a software development setting.

### **Background and Perspective**

No amount of automated tests can cover all the test scenarios and test cases related to the application user experience and design. In addition, not everything can be automated as well as not all requirements can be documented to be included in scripted testing. The practice of Exploratory Testing emphasizes the freedom and creativity of test engineers to spot defects in applications. In our view, this approach should be part of a comprehensive testing strategy for a software development organization.

Exploratory Testing focuses on discovery and relies on the guidance of the individual tester to uncover defects that are not easily covered by other tests. If the requirement is not fully documented or clear then the testing team can start exploring the application to understand its main features and “how it works?”. The idea is to start exploring the application from an end-user perspective similar to how a typical end-user would interact with the application for the first time.


### **How does it work**

* **Understanding the Requirements**
  - ollaboration with individuals possessing good product knowledge, such as senior test engineers and developers
  
* **Exploration and Documentation**
  - Exploring the application organically, without predefined test cases or a set plan (this will simulate an actual end-user exploring the application)
   - Documenting  observations from the exploration, noting potential areas of interest, test scenarios, and anything else that is relevant
  

* **Consultation with Domain Experts**
  - Sharing the exploration document with domain experts to validate understanding of the application
  - Updating the document based on their insights and feedback

* **Testing Based on Knowledge**
  - Utilizing the documented knowledge to conduct exploratory testing
  - Focus on areas identified during exploration and in consultation with domain experts

#### **Benefits of Exploratory Testing**

##### **Real time decision making**

This approach allows testers to identify errors faster and provide feedback to developers quickly to improve efficiency and  avoid the dreaded silo effect.

##### **Better understanding of  the product**

Testers can freely and organically evaluate the application to develop a better understanding of the product, its functionality, etc. It's a way to take your head off the wheel and look at things from the perspective of a real end-user.

##### **Can be applicable across different stages of SDLC**

This approach can be applicable across different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) For example, at the Requirement Analysis stage where there is a need to gather information on the system for test planning, exploratory testing can be used to gain valuable insights. This approach can even be used for unit, functional, load testing situations

## **Conclusion**

Exploratory Testing is a powerful and flexible approach that lends itself well to certain testing scenarios. Its ability to adapt to changing requirements, efficiently detect bugs, and provide comprehensive test coverage makes it a valuable tool in a tester's toolkit. However, it is essential to recognize that exploratory testing is not a one-size-fits-all solution. There are situations where more structured and scripted testing approaches may be better suited. Testing applications in highly regulated industries or when specific compliance standards must be met are cases where Exploratory Testing cannot be adopted easily.
