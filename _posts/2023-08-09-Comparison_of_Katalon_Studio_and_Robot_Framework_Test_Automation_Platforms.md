## **Overview**
Katalon and Robot Framework platforms have become very popular in the functional Test Automation space. This document
attempts to compare these two platforms across common features.

## **Problem Statement**


Even though Test Automation as a practice and automation platforms have been around for a while, their adoption has
lagged behind in general. Recently, one of our customers approached us with a request to compare and contrast Katalon
and Robot Framework based on their specific use case. Their primary objective was to automate most of their regression
testing so that their development team could move rapidly with a drastically shortened feedback loop for any newly
introduced features.

## **Conclusion**
Both Katalon Studio and Robot Framework are excellent test automation platforms with their own pros and cons. The choice
of the platform to use really depends on the project requirements and the technical skillset of the test engineering
team managing it. Katalon Studio lends itself well for less technically inclined users by supporting a quick setup, good
build-in features (commercial version). Robot Framework is more flexible and supports customizations with a wide range
of plugins, but as with any open-source platform, it requires a team with decent development skills to maintain the
tests or extend the features with suitable plugins.
